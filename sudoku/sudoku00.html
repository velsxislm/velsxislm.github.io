    <h1>Welcome to Sudoku Game!</h1>
    <h3>Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle.</h3>
    <p>In classical Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9*9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3*3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.</p>
    <p>This game consists of three puzzles of increasing difficulty, which are 3*3, 6*6, and 9*9. Click the button below to start!</p>
